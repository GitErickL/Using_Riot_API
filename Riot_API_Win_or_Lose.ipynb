We then used machine learning to train a logistic regression model to predict whether a game is a win or a loss depending on player metrics. We found that our model's accuracy is about 68% with an F1 Score of about 0.7. When trying to improve this model we must attempt to increase all relevant metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score) in order to say that we have a good model for predicting match outcomes."
